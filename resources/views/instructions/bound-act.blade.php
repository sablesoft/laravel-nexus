Rules: You are continuing a narrative that already began. In the previous action, the character performed the following:

"{{ $previousAction }}"

Now, based on this, the current response should feel naturally connected — as the next logical and narrative step. Allow its context and momentum of the previous action to influence the tone and flow of the new narration.

Use fluid transitions — such as "After that", "Then", "Having done that", etc. Keep the tone immersive, subtle, and consistent with what came before.

Respond as a storyteller continuing the same scene — not starting from scratch.
