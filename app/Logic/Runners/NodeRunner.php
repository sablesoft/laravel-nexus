/**
 * NodeRunner is responsible for executing a logic node (NodeContract),
 * which can either be an interface element (Control or Transfer models) on the screen (Screen model),
 * or a step (Step model) inside a scenario (Scenario model).
 *
 * Each node is executed in the following sequence: before -> logic -> after.
 * Any of these blocks may be missing. The before and after blocks are user-defined DSL instructions
 * that can manipulate global system state.
 *
 * The core logic block (logic), if present, is delegated to LogicRunner.
 * This allows a node to act as a wrapper around a full LogicContract entity
 * (e.g. each Step may embed a nested Scenario; similarly, a Control button or input
 *  may launch a complex scenario with multiple steps).
 *
 * ---
 * Environment:
 * - Accessible via the facade App\Logic\Facades\NodeRunner
 * - Called from App\Livewire\Chat\Play when executing control logic on a screen
 * - Invoked by LogicRunner when iterating through a logicâ€™s node list via logic.getNodes()
