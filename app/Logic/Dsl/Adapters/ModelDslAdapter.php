/**
 * ModelDslAdapter is responsible for safe and restricted access to Eloquent model attributes
 * within DSL expressions. This adapter is automatically applied by the platform during Process
 * initialization for all core models (Chat, Screen, Member, Memory) unless they provide their own adapter.
 *
 * Its main purpose is to filter out unsafe or unwanted values, such as model relations,
 * collections, and complex objects. Only scalars, arrays, enums (UnitEnum), and Carbon dates
 * are allowed. Carbon objects are further wrapped into a CarbonDslAdapter.
 *
 * This adapter also serves as a base class for custom model-specific adapters,
 * which can extend it to introduce additional logic and methods.
 *
 * ---
 * Environment:
 * - Used internally by Process to wrap models: chat, screen, memory, member
 * - Can be replaced with a custom adapter if the model implements HasDslAdapterContract;
 *   such adapters usually extend this base class
 * - Participates in DSL evaluation: accessed via ExpressionLanguage to resolve variables
 *   and adapter methods during logic execution
